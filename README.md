Assignment: CSS Hell
====================

Modifications to Project Gutenberg HTML files:
==================================================

- I removed the CSS styles inside the <script> tags in each gutenberg file.
- All three html files use styles.css style sheet.
- Modified the color scheme, by changing the background color, text color, and hyperlink/hover color.
- All three files used fig class, so I used the class to style the image in css by resizing it.
- Theme the paragraphs and headers by changing font weight and type by using google fonts library.
- More specifically changed google font type to 'Noto Serif JP', serif for all paragraph, headers, and image captions.
- Fixed indentation and alignment of text.
